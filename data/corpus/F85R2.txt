# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram. The outer frame consists
#   of a ring of text between two faint mechanically-drawn circles. The
#   starting point of the text is not evident. ( The whole arc between
#   08:00 and 10:00 is unreadable in the source image. There is also an
#   extra-wide gap at 07:30, but it may be just a faded word.)
#
#   At the center of the diagram is a sun with neutral expression
#   and narrow reverse-S-shaped rays. Surrounding it is a colored disk
#   textured with a whirlpool pattern, bent clockwise-out.
#
#   The disk is framed by a circular band with six semicircular lobes
#   (one each at North and South, two each at West and East), containing
#   a ring of text and delimited by two narrow, decorated, cordon-like
#   borders. A double radial stroke, cutting across the frame at 09:00,
#   seems to mark the starting point of the text. The inner border of
#   the frame consists of two mechanically drawn circles, about a
#   millimeter apart, and is decorated by 10 pairs of double parentheses
#   ((   )). The outer border is a hand drawn solid double line with a
#   line of dots down the middle.
#
#   The space between the inner and outer frames is divided into unequal
#   sectors by four beams, placed like the arms of an "X". The beams are
#   narrower near the center than at the periphery. Each beam continues
#   past and under the outer frame, ending in a broad plume, resembling
#   a soft wet brush. The plume makes a sharp U-turn and passes again
#   behind the outer frame, while tapering down to a point. The NE plume
#   bends clockwise, the other three bend counterclockwise.
#
#   Each sector between the outer and inner frames contains a paragraph
#   of text near the outer end (to be read clockwise), and a human
#   figure. The sex of the figures is indeterminate, as neither breasts
#   nor beards are visible. The South figure is leaning on a staff, and
#   looks like an old man or woman; the other three could be women or
#   young men, possibly children.
#
#   The figures are partially hidden behind by the inner frame: the
#   South figure is hidden from the knees down by the inner frame, and
#   the other three are hidden from the waist down. All four figures
#   wear a colored, buttonless shirt, with long and narrow sleeves,
#   which in the South figure is seen to be a tunic or dress, ending
#   just above the knee. Ring collars are visible in the North and West
#   figures. All three figures have light hair, bushy over the ears and
#   cropped just below them. The East figure wears a dark
#   skullcap.
#
#   The right hands of West, North, and East are hidden by the inner
#   frame. With the left hand, North seems to be pointing to the last
#   word of the text above (which sits on a line by itself); East holds
#   an unidentified dark object, consisting of two stacked bulbs of unequal
#   size, topped by a short spike (it could be a root); and West seems
#   to be holding a flower, shaped like a lily but dark colored. South
#   holds a staff with the left hand, and a chain with three huge rings
#   on his right.
#
# Comments:
#
#   It has been conjectured that the four figures represent the Four
#   Ages of Man. If the diagram is to be read clockwise, like the text,
#   then West (who lies over the "start marker", by the way) would be
#   Infancy. However, East (with the skullcap) looks younger than the
#   other three.

#
# Description:
#
#   This face of the fold-out contains an elaborate diagram consisting
#   of nine main circular diagrams or "rosettes" connected by things
#   that resemble roads, rivers, tubes, etc. Using compass directions
#   as labels for the rosettes, the general layout is roughly like this:
#
#      *
#     = NW----N----NE
#     = | \   |   / |
#       |     |     |
#       W--- Ctr----E
#       |  *  |     |
#       | /   |   \ |
#       SW----S----SE
#      o
#
#   (The right 1/3 of this design is incomplete and based on verbal
#   descriptions by others; I have not seen panels f86r5 and
#   f86r6 yet.)
#
#   The top and bottom rosettes lie one in each of the six panels,
#   roughly centered. The rosettes in the middle row sit on top of the
#   horizontal fold. The center rosette is the largest one
#   while the mid-side ones (N, E, S, W) are the smallest.
#
#   There is a ring of text around each rosette, and dozens of labels
#   all over the place. Unfortunately the copy on which this
#   description is based is almost illegible and is lacking the entire
#   East column of the diagram (panels f86r6 and f86r5).
#
#   Several object in this diagram seem to be covered by tongue-like
#   "scales" or sprouts (see glossary).  In several places these scales
#   pile up into a small conical mound or "fountain", which seems to emit
#   a small "jet" (which looks like a tuff of stiff hair).
#
#   The NW rosette (panel f85v2):
#
#     This rosette is surrounded by by two thin mechanically drawn
#     circles that bound a ring of text, with a wide gap at 09:30.
#     Inside this ring is a band of scales turned inwards, giving the
#     impression of a hollow spherical shell with closely-packed
#     finger-like buds sprouting from the inside surface. The band of
#     scales is fringed with a band of hairs, also pointing inwards,
#     and a circle of small dots.
#
#     At the center of this "shell" is a round (slightly oblong)
#     object, also decorated with scales, hairs, and tiny dots
#     but pointing outwards. The object seems to have a opening shaped
#     like an eye on its side, as if a slice had been cut from a
#     melon. The interior of the object seems to be hollow. The edges
#     of the hole are fringed with many small "teeth" or "flames",
#     sharp and curved, directed inwards. On the right edge of the
#     cut, on the boundary between the scales and the flames, there is
#     a single word.
#
#     North, East, and South of the NW rosette there is a complex of
#     scalloped and hatched areas that suggests a very rough surface.
#     Cutting through this hatching, and apparently higher than it, are
#     some flat areas that resemble broad wawering roads. One "road"
#     connects the rosette to a wide flat "plateau" North of it, that
#     extends beyond the panel's edge. Another road goes East to the
#     N rosette (panel f86r4) and a third road goes South to the
#     W rosete (split between panels f85v1 and f85v2).
#
#     The East-going (NW to N) road narrows quickly, and is
#     interrupted halfway by a round court. (Actually the court is
#     foreshortened to an oval; this part of the diagram is drawn as
#     seen from due West, high above the road.) Two narrow
#     paths---slightly convex, with parapets---connect this plaza to
#     the N rosette. The trapezoidal space between the two paths could
#     be a hole or a flowerbed. The road and plaza are edged by an
#     artificial-looking wall, interrupted by a few square columns or
#     towers of the same height. In the middle of the road there is a
#     round multistory tower, with a sharp conical roof.
#
#     The South-going (NW to W) road sports five labels: one at each
#     end, one in the middle, and one on each side, outside the road.
#     It is apparently drawn as seen obliquely from the South.
#
#     Five straight tubes exit from the NW rosette's outline, directed
#     Southeast towards the center rosette. They seem supported at
#     their base by a rampart with multiple scalloped outline. The
#     tubes are arranged symmetrically, with one in center and four,
#     slightly narrower, around it. They stop in mid-air with flat
#     open ends, as if all were cut with a single stroke. There is a
#     label further ahead of the tubes and aligned with their axis.
#
#     Further nortwest of this rosette, right next to the panel's
#     corner, there is a small sun with long sinuous rays. West of the
#     rosette, squeezed against the left edge of the panel, is a
#     narrow text with two paragraphs of 4.0 (or 5.0?) and 4.0 lines.
#
#   The NE rosette (panel f86r6)
#
#     This panel is missing in my copy. However one can see part of
#     the road connecting the NE rosette to the N rosette. What can be
#     seen is almost a mirror image of the road from NE to N: a
#     broadening road, edged by artifical walls with square posts or
#     towers. However there is no flower bed dividing the road in two,
#     as there is on the other side. The plaza and fountain, if any,
#     lie in panel <f86r6>.
#
#   The SW rosette (panel f85v1)
#
#     The SW rosette is bounded by a ring of text (unit "C1") bordered two
#     faint mechanically drawn circles.  There are gaps in the text at
#     01:30 and 07:30.
#
#     Inside the text ring is a "plateau" with scalloped boundary,
#     with 8 extensions or "passages" leaving in different directions.
#     Each passage has a peculiar outline, sort of a pair of trumpets
#     joined at their narrow ends by a "bulb-like" swelling. The passages
#     are flat like the plateau but are surrounded by a several wavy
#     lines, sugegsting cliffs. One "passage" goes North, one West, two
#     South, three East, and one (narrower, with two swellings, each
#     with a dot inside) goes SouthEast. The passages going North and
#     East are more or less aligned with the roads between the SW,
#     W, and S rosettes, that start just outside the text ring.
#     However the match is not perfect, as if the text ring marked an
#     ellipsis or a change of scale.
#
#     Inside the scalloped area there is an elliptical "flower bed"
#     surrounded by a band of scales. At the four cardinal points, the
#     scales pile up into four fountains, whose jets point at nothing in
#     particular. The flower bed is filled with 24 tiny flowers or
#     stars. In the center there is a flower-like object with 6 round
#     "petals" and a doubly-traced outline.
#
#     There are several labels (unit "B1") on or near this rosette.
#     One label in the scalloped-outline area, at 07:30, seems
#     associated with the area itself, or the flower bed inside it.
#     Another 9 labels seem associated with the 8 "passages" leaving the
#     scalloped area, and perhaps with the fountains at the corners of
#     the flower bed. Two more labels lie on the "sea", between the
#     text ring and the scalloped area, at 08:00 and 11:00. Four more
#     labels, reading radially outwards, lie just outside the text
#     ring, between 04:30 and 06:00; they may be associated with the
#     passages going Southeast (although they are not aligned with
#     them).
#
#     Outside the text ring, Northwest from the rosette, there is a
#     roundish textured area surrounded by several wavy lines,
#     resembling a small "island" with steep coastline. A broad,
#     slighlty divergent band with wavy outlines, resembling a
#     torrential stream of water, goes from the island to the edge of
#     plateau (passing under the text ring). Two curves lines of text
#     are written along the stream's axis, and a third is written
#     along its Southern edge. On the Northeast side of the island
#     there is a tuff of curved hairs, so that the island looks like
#     an onion with its roots.
#
#     On the opposite side of the rosette (07:30), also outside the
#     text ring there is a small circle (with double outline decorated
#     with 8 sets of three cross-hatches). The circle is surrounded by
#     a short ring of text (half clockwise and half counterclockwise).
#     Inside the circle there are three dots connected into an "L"
#     with equal arms. Two labels, reading radially towards the the
#     rosette, lie on each side of the small circle. A "dock"
#     resembling a double-traced squarish "U" extends out of the SW
#     rosette towards the small circle.
#
#     Connecting the SW and W rosettes there is a "road", looking like
#     a causeway bordered by artificial-looking walls. The road is
#     actually a diamond-shaped loop, with slightly concave sides. The
#     North and South corners of this diamond connect to the two
#     rosettes; the West and East corners of the diamont open into
#     small round courts. Around this diamond are some wavy lines that
#     suggest steep rocky cliffs. The four corners of the diamond are
#     labeled, and there are two more labels in the "sea" on both
#     sides (all in unit "B1" too).
#
#     The SW and S rosettes are connected by a broad bowtie-shaped
#     "isthmus", apparently with steep rocky shores. A thick
#     "fortified wall", fringed with "M"-shaped merlets on both sides,
#     runs along the Southern "shore" of the isthmus. North of this
#     wall are two triangular "fields", taking up most of the
#     isthmus, covered by parallel lines and many vertical sticks or
#     poles. There is a label just north of the wall, and another
#     just off the Northern "shore".
#
#   The SE rosette (panel f86r5)
#
#     This panel is not available, but on panel f86r3 one can see half of the connection
#     between rosette SE and rosette S.  This connection too is a bow-shaped isthmus.
#     The multiple wavy outlines suggest steep shores on both sides. There is a
#     narrower bowtie-shaped "road" on the isthmus, next to the South shore cliff.
#     This road has no parapets or merlets, but its edges are scalloped. Between
#     the road and the North shore cliffs there is a band of scales, pointing seawards.
#     There are two labels (unit "B3") just off the shore, one on each side of the
#     isthmus.
#
#   The N rosette (panel f86r4)
#
#     This rosette is surrounded by ring of text (unit "V2"). The ring
#     is fairly round but the presumed guiding circles are not
#     visible.
#
#     Just inside this ring there is a band of scales, as in the NE
#     rosette. However there are no hairs or dots. Instead the scales
#     seem to pile up into 13 conical "fountains" (11 visible and 2
#     inferred), pointing inwards.
#
#     The fountains seem to be blowing or spraying a "windmill" that
#     takes up most of the space inside the rosette. Each fountain
#     points into the notch between consecutive "blades" of the
#     windmill. In each sector, between consecutive fountains, there are
#     10 labels, aligned with the tips of the windmill blades, reading
#     radially inwards. (Two of the sectors are hidden by the
#     "waterfall", see below.)
#
#     The central "windmill" resembles the central structure of the
#     diagram in <f68v1>. It consists of a fat star (or toothed disk)
#     divided into 13 "blades" or sectors shaped like narrow kites.
#     Each sector is split lengthwise into a solid dark-colored half
#     (the most clockwise one) and a "starry" half. The latter
#     contains many tiny stars against a colored background. The
#     approximate star counts, clockwise from North, are
#
#       sector 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13
#              -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
#       stars  11 10 10 10 09 10 11 10 11 10 11 10 10
#
#     The actual counts may be one or two higher.  Thus there are
#     133 stars, perhaps a little more.  This is almost exactly twice
#     the total number of stars in the windmill of <f68v1> (66-67).
#
#     A "flow" of some sort seems to be taking place between the
#     windmill's South edge and the central rosette. The flow has
#     triangular or conical shape, and is marked with stream lines and
#     many small circles suggesting droplets. It is not entirely clear
#     which way the flow is moving; but its South end has smaller
#     "droplets", and exits or enters a hole at the top of a conical
#     pile of scales, similar to the fountains inside the N rosette
#     but larger.
#
#     A narrow stick or tube, with a round swelling near its tip,
#     extends Southwards from the center of the windmill, for about
#     half its radius. (It is probably perpendicular to the windmill's
#     plane, but drawn as if looking from a North-South direction.)
#
#   The S rosette (panel f86r3)
#
#     This rosette, like the others, is framed by a ring of text
#     (unit "C2") between two faint mechanically drawn circles. There is a wide
#     gap in the text between 06:00 and 06:45.
#
#     The space inside the ring is largely occupied by
#     a "windmill" object somewhat similar to the one inside
#     the N rosette.  This windmill too has the outline of a fat
#     star divided into 13 narrow kite-shaped sectors. However,
#     instead of being bisected into dark and light halves,
#     here the sectors alternate between dark solid color
#     and starry sky pattern.  The necessary exception
#     is the sector at 08:00, which is bisected by a
#     wavy line that slaloms between two rows of dots;
#     the clockwise half is starry, the other is solid dark.
#     The star counts per sector, starting with this one, are
#
#       sector  01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13
#               -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
#       stars   12 -- 19 -- 25 -- 24 -- 26 -- 22 -- 24
#
#     i.e. 152 stars.
#
#     There is no tube at the center of the windmill, only a
#     faint circular marking, possibly containing two Voynichese
#     letters.
#
#     At the tip of almost every sector there is a small round bulb,
#     and attached to almost every bulb is a fan-like structure
#     of varying width. When present, the fan starts from a small
#     pointed spike at the at distal end of the bulb, and stops at the
#     surrounding text ring. For the broadest fans, the spike seems to
#     have opened to a crown of points. More precisely, starting from
#     the split sector at 08:00 we have
#
#       sector            01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 ** 12 ** 13
#                         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
#       bulb at tip        Y  Y  Y  Y  ?  ?  ?  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  ?  Y  Y
#       spike(S)/rown(W)   S  S  S  S  ?  ?  ?  S  S  S  W  ?  ?  ?  W
#       fan width(N,0..2)  2  ?  ?  N  N  N  N  0  N  0  1  2  2  2  2
#
#     The two "**" entries above refer to a pair of "extra" fans that
#     start from narrow stalks growing from the notch between two star tips.
#
#     Some of the bays between consecutive star tips contain labels
#     (unit "B2"), reading radially inward.
#
#     Symmetrically to the N rosette, there is a big fan-shaped flow
#     between an aperture in the central rosette and the whole North
#     edge of the windmill. The flow is marked with stream lines
#     (diverging from the North vertex) and small chevrons pointing
#     South, towards the windmill. The flow seems to emanate from a
#     bottle-shaped nozzle on the wall of the central rosette.
#
#   The W rosette (on the fold between panels f85v1 and f85v2)
#
#     This rosette is similar to the North and South ones, in that it
#     has a ring of text (unit "N1") surrounding a "windmill", which
#     is sprayed by a "flow" emanating from the central rosette.
#     However the fold and the poor copy quality prevent us from
#     checking many of the details that are visible in the other two.
#
#     The text ring is interrupted at 09:45 by a decorated rectangle
#     (a laterally compressed version of the "notched square" marker).
#
#     The West windmill is smaller than its North and South
#     companions. It is divided into 18 kite-shaped sectors,
#     alternating beyween solid medium-light color and starry sky
#     pattern. Clockwise from 09:00, the star counts are
#
#       sector   01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
#                -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
#       stars    ?? -- >6 -- 07 -- 05 -- ?? -- 10 -- 09 -- 09 -- 10 --
#
#     So there are more than 56, probably around 80 stars on this windmill.
#
#     About two dozen thin beams or "stalks" emanate from the windmill
#     (both from the tips of the sectors and from the throughs between
#     sectors). the stalks end in round bulbs. These in turn are
#     connected to a scalloped circle that resembles a ring of round
#     arches.
#
#     The "flow" is somewhat smaller than the North and South ones,
#     and consists of several tinsel-like strands with the barbs
#     pointing towards the windmill; it is similar to the South flow,
#     but the barbs are pointing in the opposite sense.  The
#     strands converge on (or diverge from a point on the wall
#     of the center rosette---which is unfortunately obscured by the fold.
#
#     Between the text ring and the arches there are 8 labels (one of them,
#     obscured by the fold), reading radially inwards (unit "M1").
#
#   The central rosette (on the fold between panels f86r3 and f86r4).
#
#     The usual text ring (unit "N2") is surrounded in this case by a
#     complex band, entirely covered with outward-pointing scales and
#     other structures. Exposed scales are seen to have a dark spot
#     near the middle. The band of scales is edged on the outside with
#     many triangular "teeth" (spines, flames, grass blades) and then
#     by a ring of tiny dots. The inner edge of the band has a row of
#     fan-shaped elements (resembling gingko leaves),also pointing
#     outwards. From among the scales thre arises at regular inervals
#     a group of five or six tubes (a wide one at the center, with
#     smaller and shorter tubes surrounding it). All tubes have
#     an open, clean-cut end.
#
#     Inside the text ring there are two additional concentric bands
#     of outward-pointing scales.   The outermost of these two bands
#     is fringed by hairs, also pointing outwards.
#
#     In the annular space between the text ring and the the second
#     band of scales there are 19 labels, reading radially inwards ---
#     all between 17:30 and 02:30.
#
#     Around the North half of that annular space there is also a thin
#     semicircular line that is interrupted several times by
#     triple-scalloped indentations.
#
#     The inner band of scales is a bit flattened, like a disk seen in
#     perspective. Inside the band there are half a dozen "mushrooms"
#     in a circle. Each mushroom consists of a "stalk" and a "head",
#     topped by a "roof". The stalk is a chubby cylinder with its
#     bottom half encased in a short "sock" that flares out near the
#     ground, then narrows again. The "head" is spherical and
#     featureless. The "roof" is shaped like an upside-down trumpet,
#     with thick lip, and ends with a sharp point at the top.
#
#     Further inside the mushroom ring there is a ring of unidentified
#     shapes (perhaps resembling human silhouettes), and a dotted area
#     which may represent plants.
#
#     Between the mushrooms there are a few words of text (also in
#     unit "M2").
#
# Comments:
#
#   LOW-LEVEL INTERPRETATION
#
#   I.e. what objects was the artist trying to draw?
#
#   The hatched areas outside the rosettes could be sea waves, rocky terrain,
#   flesh, clouds, cave walls, and many other things.  However the details
#   of the NE to N road sugegst they are cliffs rising from the sea.
#
#   The object inside NE rosette could be a cutaway view of a hollow
#   shell, with a layer of "scales" on the outside, and
#   inward-pointing flames or spines on the inside. The label seems to
#   be applied the shell itself.
#
#   The opening could also be a mouth with teeth; but the shape,
#   curvature, and slant or the "teeth" are not correct. It could also
#   be eye with eyelashes; but the same objection applies, and there
#   is no hint of iris and pupil.
#
#   The tower-like structure on the N to NE road could be a fountain.
#   There are faint markings South of it that could be a puddle of water,
#   or a standing person (with one arm on the "fountain"), or...
#
#   The two roads connecting the N rosette to the plaza West of it
#   could be either bridges or, two lanes separated by a flower bed.
#
#   The knobs at the corners of the SW-W road could be towers seen
#   from dead above (the apparent perspective for this part of the
#   drawing), dropping straight down to the sea level. But they could
#   also be landing pads at sea level...
#
#   The grooved areas North of the wall on the SW-S isthmus could
#   represent plowed and planted fields, or vineyards.
#
#   HIGH-LEVEL INTERPRETATION
#
#   I.e. what is the purpose of this picture?
#
#   The sun in the NE corner suggests a cosmological interpretation.
#   On the other hand, the tubes suggest anatomy, or (less likely)
#   plumbing, while the roads and tower suggest a map.
#
#   The whole diagram may be a graphic equivalent of the description
#   of the cosmos given in 1 Enoch and other ancient texts, where
#   natural phenomena like planetary motions, rivers, winds, rains,
#   springs, etc. are said to be produced in some "cosmic factory".
#
#   Alternatively, it could be a "biological factory" explanation of
#   human physiology.
#
#   Perhaps this diagram is an attempt to draw the mysterious device
#   described in the Cabal, or the apocalyptic vision of Ezra, or
#   Heron's hydraulic gadgets, or...
#
#   Just to cover all the bases: it could be a report from a time
#   traveler or UFO abductee: the NW rosette is a fusion reactor, the
#   pipes leaving it carry steam for heating, the N/S/W/E rosettes are
#   steam turbines, the bulb-headed towers in the center are
#   rockets... 8-)
#
#   Another possibility is that it is a "fantasy island", like many
#   kids like do draw (and grown-ups too---consider Tolkien's maps of
#   Middle Earth)
