#
# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram, framed by two faint
#   mechanically drawn circles, each surrounded by a ring of text.
#
#   The whole is surrounded by another thin circle, about 1cm further
#   out, that begins looking mechanically drawn but at some point
#   wanders off and fails to close on itself, as if the fixed leg of the
#   compass had skipped a bit. (However, this outermost circle may be a
#   modern scribble on the copy.)
#
#   A thick radial stroke at 10:30 connects this outermost circle to the
#   next one, through the gap between two words of the outer text ring.
#   Another pair of thick radial strokes at 10:00 connects the second
#   and third circles, breaking the second text ring.
#
#   At the center of the diagram is a sun, with narrow flipped
#   S-shaped rays and a human face (with neutral expression, straight
#   hair combed back at the sides, held by a narrow headband with
#   dots.)
#
#   Surrounding the sun is a "starry windmill": a fat star with
#   serrated outline, consisting of 16 sectors shaped like narrow
#   kites, each split radially into a "light" (clockwise) half, with a
#   dotted line and some small stars, and a "dark" half, painted with
#   a solid dark color. Clockwise from the 10:00 point, the light
#   half-sectors contain the following counts of stars:
#
#     4 4 4 3 4 4 5 6 6 6 7 7 6 5 5 5
#     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     * * *   * * * * * * * * * * * *
#                 * * * * * * * * * *
#                   * * * * * *
#                         * *
#
#   All told there are 66 stars. (But the star count of 7 in the 06:30
#   sector may be an 8.
#
#   Thin radial lines connect each point of the star to the
#   inner edge of the frame. The 16 sectors defined by these lines
#   are alternatingly filled with unnamed stars, or labeled with
#   a radial text line, reading outwards.  Clockwise from the
#   10:00 ray, the sectors contain the following counts:
#
#     8 7 7 8 9 9 8 7
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * *
#     *     * * * *
#             * *
#
#   There are 63 stars in total.
#
#   There is a comet-tail-like object behind one of the stars in
#   the 03:00 sector.
#
# Comments:
#
#   It is not clear whether the "start here" strokes at 10:00-10:30
#   are original, or modern guesses scribbled on the copy. If the
#   latter, then they seem wrong, because those word gaps are quite
#   ordinary and not aligned.
#
#   Another possible starting place is at 01:15, where both rings have
#   aligned, extra-wide word breaks.
#
#   On the other hand, the EVA "p" on the the 10:30 radial line suggests
#   that that is indeed the first line.
#
#   The center figure is probably female.
#
#   Note that the small and large star counts are almost the same (67
#   and 63); perhaps 64 was the intended number. Note also that the
#   small star counts are unimodal. The big star counts would be
#   unimodal too if the 11:00 sector had 7 stars, or the 09:30 sector
#   had 8. The latter seems more likely as it would have bumped the
#   number of big stars to 64. In both sequences the minimum is around
#   01:10 (the aligned breaks!) and the maximum around 07:00.
#
#   The "tail" in the 03:00 sector may mean that one of the stars is a comet.
