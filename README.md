# voynich-os

Voynich OS is a computational reconstruction of the Voynich Manuscript as a symbolic process language.  
It provides a tokenizer, relational-operator classifier, state-suffix model, formal grammar, and a safe,
reproducible virtual-machine layer capable of interpreting manuscript text into structured state-transition
graphs.

This repository is intentionally simple, deterministic, and non-adaptive. It is designed for open research
and reproducible analysis of the manuscript’s glyph structure.
